All textures must have .TGA format with available alpha channel.
Only square resolutions with power of 2 pixels (64/128/1024/2048 etc) acceptable.

Textures has been remastered in several steps:
1) Convert original TGA file to JPEG
2) Enlarge JPEG picture via AI Gigapixel programm (https://topazlabs.com/gigapixel-ai/)
Usually x4 scale factor used but in some cases x8 or even x16 used. (e.g. for backgrounds)
3) Convert JPEG to TGA without alpha-channel
4) Enlarge original TGA file with simple bicubic interpolation.
5) Copy alpha-channel from simply enlarged original TGA file to JPEG-sourced TGA
6) Save as final texture
7) Profit

Folders m032-m256 contains unique textures happened to be the biggest in the original files.
E.g. if Dragon texture exist in original m256, m128 and m64, in this repository it will be only in m256 folder

/Texture path:
	Folder ClassIcons contains full set of files, enlarged.
	Folder Misc contain only part of files, that were supposed to be enlarged
	Folder Gray is not represented at all
/Ground
	All files in place enlarged x4
	
Logic for /Ground textures:
- There are 3 basic type of grounds - A, B, C with 15 examples for each. Alpha channel is always black (nothing visible)
  These textures can be observed in any world, they are universal.
  gnd_c04.tga for example.
- There are 14 types of masks, supposed to smooth transition on the connection between 2 typ of grounds.
  On the connection edge single polygon is textured with 2 grounds simulatenously, and applied transition masks as alpha channel.
  msk_aabb01.tga for example
- There are lots of world-specific details textures that are visualized on top of the ground giving each world atmosphere.
  All has prefix of the world in the beginning and actively use alpha channel
  kris_1001.tga or urw_0101.tga for example
There is engiene restriction not to apply transition masks for areas larger than equivalent of 64x64 starting from top. 
Thats mean for 256x256 ground textures will not have smooth transitions on the splits and will have rough edges.
